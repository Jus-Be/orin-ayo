# Quick Start
## Install
Orina Ayo work best with in desktop mode with a Logitech Guitar Hero Controlller or a LiberLive C1. If you do not have a guitar controller nor a keyboard midi controller, you can still use a wireless numeric keypad or the numeric keypad of your desktop computer. See supported devices below for more details.

Also note that Gamepad compatible guitar controllers like the PDP Riff Master or the Logitech Guitar hero will only work from a desktop computer. On mobile phones, only Bluetooth midi controllers or guitars like LiberLive C1 amd Lava Genie will work with OrinAyo. 

When OrinAyo works in standalone mode and not controlling an external device, generating all the music from WebAudio, you would need a high spec PC or mobile phone like an Intel iCore 7 or Apple M series laptop or a Samsung S25 spec type mobile phone.

If you are using a Bluetooth guitar controller like LiberLive C1 or Lava Genie, you must first give the web browser (Chrome or Edge) permission to acces these devices. See section on Bluetooth below for more details.

First install OrinAyo as a browser extension or as a progressive web app on your desktop or mobile phone.
