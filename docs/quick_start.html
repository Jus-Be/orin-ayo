<p>Orina Ayo work best with in desktop mode with a Logitech Guitar Hero Controlller or a LiberLive C1. If you do not have a guitar controller nor a keyboard midi controller, you can still use a wireless numeric keypad or the numeric keypad of your desktop computer. See supported devices below for more details.</p>
<p>Also note that Gamepad compatible guitar controllers like the PDP Riff Master or the Logitech Guitar hero will only work from a desktop computer. On mobile phones, only Bluetooth midi controllers or guitars like LiberLive C1 amd Lava Genie will work with OrinAyo.</p>
<p>When OrinAyo works in standalone mode and not controlling an external device, generating all the music from WebAudio, you would need a high spec PC or mobile phone like an Intel iCore 7 or Apple M series laptop or a Samsung S25 spec type mobile phone.</p>
<p>If you are using a Bluetooth guitar controller like LiberLive C1 or Lava Genie, you must first give the web browser (Chrome or Edge) permission to acces these devices. See section on Bluetooth below for more details.</p>
<p>First install OrinAyo as a browser extension or as a progressive web app on your desktop or mobile phone.</p>

<h4 id="chords">Chords</h4>
<p>The five coloured fret buttons generate CHORD midi notes which are send on MIDI channel 4 when the strum bar goes up or down.  Twenty chord shapes are supported. There are six basic popular chords (I, IIm, IIIm, IV, V &amp; VIm) playable with a single or two fingers and fourteen other less used chords requiring two, three or even four fingers. The chord mapping in Nashville number format is fixed for now. It will become configurable in a future version.</p>

</table><p>Please note that the RC-600 Loop Station and Aeros Loop Studio have only six audio tracks. They can only play the basic six chords. However, when played together with the virtual guitars from Music Labs (RealGuitar, RealLPC, etc) in joystick mode as heard in the demo song above, the virtual guitars can handle the advanced mode chords and fill in the missing gaps. Arrangers do not have this limitation but do not sound as realistic as a looper with the exception of the Ketron Event series which can play audio tracks in their styles.</p>
<h4 id="start-and-stop">Start and Stop</h4>
<p>The button on the Directional (logo) knob used with the five coloured buttons determines how the arranger style starts and stops.</p>
<p>Pressing the button alone toggles start and stop playing the current selected musical style in the arranger.</p>
<p>Pressing the button as well as a coloured fret button starts the style as follows:</p>

<table>

</table><h4 id="style-variationssections-abcd">Style Variations/Sections (A,B,C,D)</h4>
<p>The Star-Power button and the START button are used to control the style variations.</p>
<p>When the Star-Power button is pressed on its own, it will cycles the style variations A–&gt;B–&gt;C–&gt;D–&gt;A.  When a colored fret key is also pressed, then it will play a fill for the current playing variation.<br>
The START button cycles back down from A&lt;–B&lt;–C&lt;–D&lt;–A.</p>
<h4 id="changing-song-key">Changing Song Key</h4>
<p>Moving the Directonal (logo) knob right or up steps the playing key up ( C -&gt; C#) and moving it left or down steps the playing key down (C -&gt; B).</p>
<p>Please note that this does nothing with a Looper. You have to preload the Looper with the audio files matching the song key. Both the RC 600 Loop Station and Aeros Loop Studio have memories to preload as many songs in all the needed keys for the live event.</p>
<h4 id="other-playing-features">Other Playing Features</h4>
<p>Pressing down on any of the five sections in the slider bar at the same time the strum bar is moved up or down can be used to perform other features.<br>
This includes sending Foot Switch on/off mesages to Ketron Arrangers that can be used to mute arranger parts or perform any custom feature required by the user.</p>

</table><h3 id="liberlive-c1">LiberLive C1</h3>
<p>If you select the LiberLive C1 guitar, it uses a modified 7 chord keys mapping (7b, 6m, 5, 1, 4, 2m, 3m) different from the standard (1, 2m, 3m, 4, 5, 6m, 7m) by LiberLive and much closer to the 5 buttons of a Gamepad  guitar controller.</p>
<p>It will connect to the LiberLive C1 guitar by the Bluetooth connection used by the LiberLive mobile app. You can’t use both OrinAyo and the mobile app at the same time.<br>
You can select different drum beats and guitar styles for both paddles and OrinAyo will use the tempo set by LiberLive except for web-audio styles that have fixed tempos.</p>
<h3 id="lava-genie">Lava Genie</h3>
<h3 id="artiphon-instrument-1-and-chorda">Artiphon Instrument 1 and Chorda</h3>
<p>With Artiphon Instrument 1 and Chorda, only the first five pads are used like a Guitar Hero controller. The strum bridge pads are used to provide control (strum, start/stop, fill, next/previous section).</p>
